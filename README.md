Peer Review: Gianpaolo Reinares

Comments: Everything looks perfect to the Example; transition between light and dark mode is smooth; for the colored bars/borders on the top of the LargeCard, I would suggest using a rounded-t instead of a rounded to match with the example; in Dark Mode, remove the white borders from the cards; besides that, everything looks and functions great.
